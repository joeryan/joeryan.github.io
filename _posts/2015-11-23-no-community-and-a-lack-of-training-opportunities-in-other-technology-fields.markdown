Something I've been thinking about a lot lately is community and other technology
fields.  It seems like every programming language and at least a few operating systems
have their own user group or meeting in the local area.  Now maybe that's due to
the smaller community I'm currently in, but it seems like that was the case in
Columbus, OH as well.  In addition to this lack of community among people in the
Networking, database, and storage communities; I wonder about the number of
learn to code boot camps and kids programs geared toward programming.  I realized
a few things and I think the greater technology community needs to address them.

Number one on this list is community.  If you work in a particular field of
expertise, you should probably participate in that community.  If there isn't a
local group that meets and you are in a town of any size, YOU should start
that meeting to encourage others and pass along your knowledge.  Even if it's
only two or three people that meet and talk about the specialization, there is
something that could probably be shared. In view of that, I'm going to start a
packet tracer meeting to chat with other network folks.  Hopefully I can get at
least a couple people to join me to chat about what's new and cool in the network
space.

Number two is finding a way to provide that experience and help people find out
about those other branches of the Tech field.  There is training out there for
low cost or no cost, but it seems like programming is the cool thing and it makes
everyone think that-s what working in the technology sector is all about.  There
are jobs and careers out there in networking, data analysis, storage,
virtualization, and support.  Another problem is gaining experience in those
areas.  Network gear, storage, and servers all cost real money and no one wants
learners playing with their production systems.  There has to be a good way to let
people experiment and learn with hardware the same way we can break software and
learn what works and what doesn't without selling our left arm.  To try and help
out with that, I've got plans to start some sort of non-profit space to let
people experiment and learn on production level equipment.  I want a place that
they anyone can come and learn or experiment on something new without fearing that
they might break things that "need five nines of uptime."

That's today's rant.  Hopefully it got someone else besides me energized and didn't
upset anyone too badly.  Maybe the next post won't take so long to materialize.
