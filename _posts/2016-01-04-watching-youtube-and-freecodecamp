This week I’ve been checking out a youtube video recommended by a friend of mine and reaching waypoints at FreeCodeCamp.  You can find the you tube video at How to Make a WordPress site and so far it is easy to follow and walks you right through getting started and using a good theme that the author created.  I’m only 25 minutes into it, but I think it’s pretty good so far and I’m looking forward to checking out the rest.

FreeCodeCamp on the other hand is all about getting down and dirty with the code.  Once you get a wordpress site up and running, if you want more come on over and check it out.  I’ve just gotten through the first block of waypoints for the front end, which introduce you to tho basics of front end code.  These are followed by ‘Ziplines’ which are challenges that give user stories that should be followed and an example for what functionality it should contain.  I’m really looking forward to this first one, since I needed a Professional Portfolio site anyway.

I’ll be sure to do a quick write up and post a link once I’m done!
